# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — Initial MVP

- WordPress plugin bootstrap with a zero-dependency PSR-4 autoloader
  (works from a plain ZIP upload, no `composer install` required).
- Breakdance compatibility layer: Element Studio save-location
  registration, Dynamic Data field (reading time), builder-context
  detection — all guarded so the plugin never fatals without Breakdance.
- Neumorphic design token system (light/dark surfaces, copper + technical
  blue accents, Fraunces/Libre Franklin type, motion tokens) scoped
  entirely under `.evpx-*` classes.
- Conditional asset loader: CSS/GSAP/JS only load on pages that actually
  use an EV element; GSAP registered defensively against `window.gsap`
  already existing.
- 9 elements, each a shortcode + Gutenberg block from one shared control
  schema and one render path: Hero, Section, AC/DC Comparison (signature
  component), Scenario Cards + Scenario Card, Technical Flow, FAQ + FAQ
  Item, CTA.
- GSAP motion layer (hero reveal, section reveals, comparison transition,
  FAQ panel animation, reading progress) with a fully-functional vanilla-JS
  fallback baseline — motion is enhancement only, never a dependency for
  core interactivity.
- Full demo article (rephrased AC/DC charging content, not copied from any
  reference) assembled and QA'd end-to-end in a real WordPress + Docker
  environment; see `docs/QA-REPORT.md`.
